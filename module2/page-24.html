					<p><strong> Video Transcript </strong></p>
					
					<p>Slide 1 - By the time you get to this lesson you should have an understanding of what insurance is, why we need it, and what factors effect an insurance rate.  For this lesson, we will do a high level review over various policy types that are offered by most insurance companies.</p>
					<p>Slide 2 - We will start with the most common policy, auto insurance.  There are two main types of policies, standard, for those who have lower risk factors, and nonstandard, for those who might hold higher risk factors.
								 Every company is unique for where they draw the line in standard vs nonstandard, and every insurance company has to file these guidelines with the state’s department of insurance for approval.  All insurance companies are legally required to offer the best rate they have possible for the risk they would be insuring.  
								 There are two main coverage categories on an auto policy, liability and physical damage.  Liability pays out to other people, this coverage is what can pay out if you hurt someone or damage their property in an auto accident.  These are typically referred to as Bodily Injury and Property Damage.
								 Physical damage coverage is what will help you to repair or replace your vehicle if it is damaged due to a covered loss; these are typically referred to as Comprehensive and Collision.  
								 Many companies also offer additional coverage options that you can add on. These are called endorsements.  Things like “new car replacement,” “roadside assistance,” and “accident or violation forgiveness” are only a few examples that might be available. </p>
					<p>Slide 3 - Homeowners insurance comes in two main types, named or open perils.
								 Perils are types of risks or losses, so a named perils policy covers for very specific losses like fire, theft, or vandalism, but also comes with exclusions like loss due to nuclear war or earth movement.  An open peril policy extends to more covered losses, but it also comes with a higher price.
								 The majority of homeowners’ policies written are on a named peril basis.  Both policy forms offer the same coverage options like dwelling, personal property, and liability.
								 The dwelling coverage should always be based on a fair replacement cost value of the home; this can be very different than just the purchase or market price of the home.  Replacement cost value will take into consideration the cost of materials and custom features on your home, as well as labor costs to rebuild it.
								 The personal property coverage is normally a percentage of the dwelling amount and can vary from company to company.
								 Liability on a home works similar as the auto, which means it pays out to other people if you hurt them on or off your property premises. This coverage can range for $100,000 to $1,000,000, but the average homeowner typically carries between $300,000 and $500,000.
								 Just like the auto policy, you can add endorsements to a home policy as well.  Things that can provide coverage for mold or foundation damage, and earthquakes. </p>
					<p>Slide 4 - Renters insurance is unique since you as a tenant have little to no responsibility for the structure.  You do, however, have a ton of personal property to protect.  
								 On average it is best to start your coverage between $20,000 and $30,000.  This coverage protects for named perils like fire, theft, and vandalism, and when you really start to calculate the cost to replace your clothes, furniture, cookware, dinnerware, toiletries, electronics, and accessories, many people could see totals much closer to $100,000.  
								 The liability is also unique for a renter’s policy, but will still pay in case you are found at fault if someone gets hurt. 
								 There are endorsements that you can add on like replacement cost coverage and water damage which can add a high value for very little cost to the policy.</p>
					<p>Slide 5 - Lastly, there is life insurance. Since these policies are highly regulated due to their financial impacts, today we will only discuss Term Life policies, but keep in mind there are many other types as well, even some that have long term investment value.
								 For term policies they range from 5 to 30 year terms.  So basically you can lock in the great rate for the age and health you are today and keep that rate for the next 30 years.  At the end of that 30-year term you would then need to get a new policy.  
								 These terms come in handy as you increase your net worth and obtain more assets.  For example, right now you might only need a 5 or 10-year term and only $50,000 in coverage to pay for a funeral and/or what little debt you might have.  But as you increase your net worth and assets, you might have significantly more to protect. For example, you might need a 30 years’ term policy when you buy a home, since most mortgages are 30 year terms. So, if you pass away before you can pay off your mortgage, the benefit from the life policy can pay for the mortgage balance and funeral costs, if you selected a limit high enough.
								 So before you look into life insurance, make sure you know what your current debt and asset levels are and how much an average funeral costs, which today is around $10,000.  These numbers will help you figure out what limit of coverage you need and how long it would take you to pay them off.</p>  
					<p>Slide 6 - No two insurance policies are exactly the same since many companies offer a wide variety of rating factors, coverage options, discounts and endorsements.  So the best thing you can do is shop around to find a company that offers value over price and offers great customer service and claims handling.</p>
