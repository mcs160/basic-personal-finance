					<h2> What about Condos and Townhomes? </h2>

					<p>Homeownership varies based on physical structure.  Something that we haven't looked at so far are condos and townhomes. 
					Both types of properties normally have associations that are required when you purchase a home in the planned development.
					These associations normally have high fees, but they carry the master insurance policy that insures the structure of all 
					the properties, including shared spaces like park, playgrounds and pools that are within the community.    </p>
					
					<p>Prior to purchasing or renting a home in a condominium or townhouse community make sure to ask questions of what is 
					covered on the master policy, as not to have anything double insured.  With that information you and your insurance
					advisor can review the type of property coverage needing to protect your belongings and any part of the interior structure
					of the home that you are responsible for protecting. </p>
