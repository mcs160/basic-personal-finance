					<p>Slide 1 - There are over a million different factors that can play a part into how an insurance premium is calculated.  In this segment we will talk about the ones you have some control over.</p>   
					<p>Slide 2 - First let’s look at the person, or the insured.  
								 How old are they and how many years have they been driving?  
								 There is a reason insurance rates are so high for younger or newer drivers, that’s because they are still learning and data shows young and newer drivers are more likely to be involved in an accident versus drivers with more than 3 years experience.  When you start adding in driving behaviors like tickets and accidents, and bad or no credit the rates can sky rocket.  
								 Martial status and gender do play a small role, statistics show married people and women are actually safer drivers.
								 These factors can all increase the rate of a policy, but there are ways to reduce these risks, things like good student discounts and safe driver discounts, can significantly reduced these rates.</p>
					<p>Slide 3 - Now something that is specific to car insurance is the vehicle.  Every vehicle has unique factors that come with it, things like the weight and the wheel base, and the number of cylinders.  All of this information is coded into a vehicle identification number, commonly referred to as the VIN. 
								 Year, Make, Model, and Series are also in the VIN and these are key factors in how safe the vehicle is, it’s top speeds, the crash test ratings.  Does it have seat belts and air bags?  All of these factors can increase or lower the rates on a policy
								 For example, a 2014 Subaru Impreza STI could cost almost double when compared to a standard Subaru Impreza, due to it’s performance and speed ratings.  
								 That price could grow even higher if that STI is owned and driven by a brand new driver.</p>
					<p>Slide 4 - The location is common to both auto and property insurance.  Auto insurance companies will look at typical traffic and road conditions in the area of your home location.  
								 Weather is mostly looked at for property insurance, as you might imagine those who live in hurricane or accident prone area might pay more for insurance due to those risks.
								 Property insurance companies will also look at the landscape of where properties are located, even apartment complexes.  Are they built near forest areas or on mountain or hillsides?  
								 If so they could hold the risk of wildfires or mud and landslides, these can be catastrophic losses that can and have caused entire families to go bankrupt because they didn’t have any or enough coverage.</p>   
					<p>Slide 5 - Stability is a big factor in all auto, property and life insurance policies.  Things like credit, age and marital status all play into stability ratings.  Insurance is highly based on statistics, and statistics say people with higher credit ratings have fewer losses, and as we get older we tend to settle down in our adventurous endeavors.  They also say those who are married tend to take fewer risks due to the dependency of their spouse.
								 Life insurance will also heavily look at your current and past health as well as any alcohol and drug consumption.  Basic things like height and weight can also play a part in life insurance rates due to statistics of those who lead a healthier lifestyle tend to live longer and have fewer medical complications.  
								 Of course those who have drugs, nicotine, and/or narcotics in their records have increased risks that could lead to an earlier than normal death so their rates for life insurance would be much higher than those without. </p> 
					<p>Slide 6 - The good news is you have control over many of these factors.  In fact, many companies now give you a small device to plug into your car for a little while that tells them your typical driving habits and can actually provide you discounts as high as 40 percent that can last the life of the policy.  
								 There are other things like weather and traffic conditions that you will never be able to control, but those are the less impactful factors.
								 Insurance companies are based on the law of large numbers, which is a principle of probability that tries to predict the frequencies of events with the same likelihood.
								 The more you can lower your risk factors the lower your rate will be.</p>
