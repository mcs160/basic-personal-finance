    <tr>
      <td>Color determines the price of auto insurance</td>
      <td>The color of your vehicle, may make you more susceptible to being pulled over;
      thus resulting in more points and the higher cost of insurance.  But the color does 
      NOT effect the actual rate of your policy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>It costs more to insure your car when you get older</td>
      <td>This is actually the opposite, once a driver is 25 years old an insured can see
      a drop in insurance rates, especially for men. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Your credit has no effect on your insurance rate</td>
      <td>This is false, there is something called an insurance based credit score, although it is 
      not an exact match to your FICO score it is a reflection of it.  So no credit or bad credit can cause
      you to have higher rates on your insurance.  You will learn more about managing your credit in the next module. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Your insurance will cover you if your car is stolen, vandalized or damaged 
      by falling tree limbs, hail, flood or fire</td>
      <td>There is only one coverage on a policy that will protect for these kinds of losses and it 
      is typically referred to as Comprehensive or Other than Collision coverage.  If you have a loan or lease
      the finance company will require you to have this coverage, but if your vehicle is paid off, the coverage becomes
      optional. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>If other people drive your car, their auto insurance will cover them in the
       event of an accident</td>
      <td>Most state policies consider the vehicle's insurance to be primary, so if someone else is driving
      your vehicle and is in an accident your insurance would be primary.  There are occasions where this could
      be denied, for example if the person regulary drives your car and lives in your household, they should
      have been included on your policy, if they are not, the claim could be denied since you did not disclose
      their regular access and use of the vehicle. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Personal auto insurance covers both personal and business use of your car</td>
      <td>Most companies divide their auto insurance based on personal versus business use. 
      If you are self employed or use the vehicle predominately for business personal auto insurance
      may not protect you.</td>
