					<h2>What are assets and net worth?</h2>

					 <p>Most people think of the American Dream as owning a car, then buying a home, having a family and a good job.
					But what many folks are forgetting is that all of those things are considered assets. Assets are considered a useful or valuable thing, person, or quality, 
					they are also known as property owned by a person or company, regarded as having value and available to meet debts, commitments, or legacies.</p>
					
					<p>This all plays into your net worth, that means you take the total value of all things you own (car, house, personal belongings, bank accounts) and you subtract the debt you owe (car loan, mortgage, credit card debt).
					The number you end up with is your total net worth.  Why does it matter to talk about these things in an Insurance lesson?  
					That's because if you are found at fault for an accident the injured party by law can sue you for current and future net worth.</p>
