					<p>Slide 1 - Welcome to insurance 101: today will be your first step in gaining an understanding of what insurance really is and why we all need it.</p>
					<p>Slide 2 - Insurance is an agreement or contract in which an agency provides a guarantee of compensation to an individual or business for a specific loss in the purpose of indemnification for premiums paid.
							  Now you might be asking yourself, what is indemnification?  In layman's terms it means to make one whole again.
							  This is the primary purpose of insurance, to help people recover from a major loss.</p>
					<p>Slide 3 - So why do you need to get insurance? 
							  Most would say it’s because they are legally required, and that is part of it.
							  Many would also say it’s because they have a financial responsibility, possibly a car loan or home mortgage company making them get the coverage.
							  But what most people fail to see is the protection that insurance truly offers. 
							  Imagine this, you have a car that comes with a $16,000 loan and a home with a $170,000 mortgage. You also have a credit card with a balance of $3000.
							  What would happen if you were in an accident and the car was a complete loss? Or your house burned down due to a fire in the kitchen, or even worse you pass away unexpectedly?  How would those debts be paid?  
							  Who would be responsible?  How would you replace your house or your car?</p>
