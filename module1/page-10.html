					<p><strong> Video Transcript </strong></p>
					
					<p>In this module, you learned the basics of banking and personal finance.
					You learned the definition of a bank, which is a financial institution that 
					accepts deposits of money from the public, maintains financial accounts for their customers, 
					and creates loans and credit.</p>

					<p>You should know the tools and services a bank offers to help customers manage money. 
					A savings account is used for long-term saving and earns interest on the money you deposit. 
					A checking account is used for day-to-day transactions and purchases. You can also use your ATM 
					or debit card to withdrawal money from your savings and checking account at an ATM machine. 
					You can also use checks or a debit card to make purchases or pay bills and withdrawal 
					directly from your checking account.</p>

					<p>Online banking is a great tool to manage your accounts, monitor account activity, 
					and review bank statements. We hope this review was useful. You should now be ready to take your quiz!</p>
