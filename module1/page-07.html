					<p>The actions and activities video will help you better understand 
					how to complete deposit slips and checks by walking you through the process.</p>
					
					<p> Play the video to learn how to complete deposit slips and checks. </p>
					
					<p><strong> Video Transcript </strong></p>
					<p>In Actions and Activities, you will learn about how to fill out and use 
					deposit slips and checks. There will be a chance to practice what you learn after the video.</p>
					
					<p>In this video, you will learn how to fill out a deposit slip and write a check, but first, 
					a quick review.  Deposit slips are used to put money into checking and savings accounts at 
					your bank.Checks are promissory notes used to pay for goods and services, like food or car 
					detailing, using money in your checking account.</p>
					  
					<p>The deposit slip allows you to deposit checks, cash/coins, and make withdrawals at a bank 
					using a teller. When completing a deposit slip, select which account to deposit money into 
					by marking the checking or savings box at the top of the slip. Next, write your ten-digit 
					account number in the boxes provided. Print your first name, last name and address, 
					but do not sign the deposit-slip yet. You must sign your first and last name in cursive on 
					the slip in front of the bank teller for it to be valid.  Next, print the date, the total 
					amount of cash/coins you will deposit, the total amount of all the checks combined, 
					and add together, or subtotal, the cash and check amounts.  If you would like to withdraw 
					any money, you will write in the amount in the Less Cash Rec’vd box.  Next, subtract the 
					Less Cash Rec'vd from the Subtotal to calculate your final total and write it in the bottom box. 
					While not all deposit slips are exactly the same, this tutorial should help you know what to 
					look for when filling out a deposit slip.</p> 
					
					<p>The check is a promise to pay for goods and services using money typically found in your 
					checking account.  Savings accounts may also have checks, but they are not used to pay for 
					everyday items since there is usually a limit on the number of times money can be withdrawn 
					from the account per month.  When filling out a check, write the name of the person or company 
					that you are promising to pay in the “pay to the order of” line. Next, spell-out the words of 
					the amount you are promising to pay on the line below. For example, write the word ten and then 
					10/100 to indicate $10.10. You should also draw a line so no additional amount can be written 
					in later. Next, print the date, using words and numbers or in an abbreviated form such as 12/24/16. 
					Below, write the amount you are promising to pay in numerical form. And finally, in cursive, 
					sign your first and last name on the line in the right hand corner. You may also chose to write 
					what the check is for in the memo box, but this is not required.</p>
	
					<p>We hope you have a better understanding of how to fill out a deposit slip and write a check.  
					Let’s see what you have learned.</p>
