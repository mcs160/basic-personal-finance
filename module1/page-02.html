					<p><strong> Video Transcript </strong></p>
					
					<p>Upon completion of this module, you will be able to do the following: define bank, 
					identify different accounts that banks offer, understand tools and services banks use 
					for money management, describe checks and debit cards and how they work, describe how 
					to use banking tools and services to access money, and describe basic functions of 
					online banking.</p>

					<p><strong> What is a bank? </strong></p>
					<p>A bank is a business that sells financial services such as car loans, 
					home mortgage loans, business loans, checking accounts, savings 
					accounts and credit card services. Banks can keep money for saving or commercial 
					purposes, and also for exchanging, investing, and supplying it for loans.</p>

					<p><strong> Where do banks get the money to lend? </strong></p>
					<p>Banks get their money from the people who open savings and other types of accounts. 
					All of this money combined forms a big pool of money and the bank uses that 
					pool of money to make loans. Banks act as the go between for people who deposit 
					their money into the bank and people who need to borrow money. Banks also 
					make their money from fees and interest, which weâ€™ll discuss later in this module.</p>

					<p> <strong>Is my money safe in a bank? </strong></p>
					<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, protects most types of deposits, 
					including checking and savings, up to $100,000.</p>
