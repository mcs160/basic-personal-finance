					accounts and credit card services. Banks can keep money for saving or commercial 
					purposes, and also for exchanging, investing, and supplying it for loans.</p>

					<p><strong> Where do banks get loan money? </strong></p>

					<p>Banks get their money from people who open savings and other types of accounts. 
					Banks pool all this money to make loans.Banks act as the go between for people 
					who deposit money into the bank and people who need to borrow money. Banks also 
					make money from fees and interest, which weâ€™ll discuss later in this module.</p>

					<p> <strong>Is my money safe in a bank? </strong></p>

					<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, protects most types of deposits, 
					including checking and savings, up to $100,000.</p>

					<p>Now you should have a better understanding of what a bank is and how it can 
					help you manage your money.</p>
