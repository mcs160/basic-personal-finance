					home mortgage loans, business loans, checking accounts, savings accounts, 
					and credit card services. Banks can keep money for saving or commercial purposes, 
					and also for exchanging, investing, and supplying it for loans.</p> 

					<h2>Where do banks get the money to lend?</h2>
					<p>Banks get their money from (omit all) the people who open savings and other types of accounts. 
					All of this money combined forms a big pool of money, and the bank uses that pool of money to make loans. 
					Banks act as the go between for the people who deposit their money into the bank and (omit save and) 
					the people who need to borrow money. Banks also make their money from fees and interest, 
					which weâ€™ll discuss later in this module.</p>

					<h2>Is my money safe in a bank?</h2>
					<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, protects most types of deposits, 
					including checking and savings, up to $100,000.</p>
