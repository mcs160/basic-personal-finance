					 money you deposit. A checking account is used for day-to-day transactions and purchases.</p>

					 checking account at an ATM machine. You can also use checks or a debit card 
					 to make purchases or pay bills and withdrawal directly from your checking account.</p>

					 and review bank statements.</p>

					balance between your income and your spending.</p>
