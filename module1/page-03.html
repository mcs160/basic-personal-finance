					<h3> Below is the video transcript: </h3>
					
					<p>There are five basic services to help you manage your money: savings accounts, checking accounts, 
					credit cards, loans, and investment accounts. This module will focus on savings and checking accounts, 
					and the different tools that are available to help you deposit and withdrawal money, make purchases, 
					and keep track of your finances.</p>
					
					<p>Once you set up accounts at the bank, there are several tools to help you manage your money. 
					You can use deposit slips to put money in your account, or you can use withdrawal slips to take 
					money out of your account. You can also use checks or debit cards to purchase items electronically. 
					ATM or debit card may be used to withdrawal cash from the ATM machine.</p>
					
					<p>Banks even have tools to help you keep track of your activity. You will learn about online banking, 
					which helps customers check their balance, review transactions and bank statements, and use online bill pay.</p>
